## interface|interpreter|optimizer

Application use JDBC,ODBC to connect to MYSQL'S connection pool.

Connection pool has many protection parameters;

```sql
-- 1.max_connections
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_connections';
-- set max_connections
SET GLOBAL max_connections = 1000;

-- 2.max_allowed_packet 单次最大数据报文
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_allowed_packet'
-- set max_allowed_packet
SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet = 8388608;
```

Mysql use SQL interpreter and SQL interface to translate and vertify SQL words

Application send SQL words to SQL interface,and which sends it to SQL interpreter.

If Mysql can't translate the SQL words or execute them normally,It will send false information to the Application due to SQL interface.

If the SQL words are good,which are supposed to send to SQL optimizer for optimization.

## storage_engine

storage_engine is responsible to deal with the SQL execute plan optimizered by SQL interpreter.
